# Test Data

- `build_reference`: for building reference tests
  - default:
    - LF
    - multiple lined
    - uncompressed
  - test cases:
    - (1) LF VS CRLF
    - (2) multiple lined VS two lined (=one line for sequence)
    - (3) uncompressed VS gzip compressed
- `validate_result`: for validating results
  - `default`
    - original genome: T2T-CHM13
    - generating targets
      - (1) extracting 1,000 bp with sliding 899 bp
      - (2) dividing by letter case
        - All base is upper -> prefix as `high_comp`
        - All base is lower -> prefix as `low_comp`
      - (3) sampling 1000 for each clusters -> total 2000 records
    - simulating query
      - 10,000 sequences with length of 200 bp
      - `dwgsim -N 10000 -z 0 -H -1 200 -2 0 {reference_file} {output_path}`
